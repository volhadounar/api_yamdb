        3. Make put request with body {"email":"some_mail", "confirmation_code": "some_confcode_from_email"}:
        http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/token/
        4. Input token in the request headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
        5. http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/me/ -- Fetch current profile data
